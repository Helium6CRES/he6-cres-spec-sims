# he6_cres_spec_sims

A package for simulating cres data.

## Notes as I build out the ability to run these simulations on rocks: 

* Getting an experiment running locally: 
	* `cd /home/drew/He6CRES/he6-cres-spec-sims`
	* `ipython3`
	* `/home/drew/He6CRES/he6-cres-spec-sims`

	* Ok I'm trying to get this to work with a command line argument but it all of a sudden
	doesn't like my relative imports. Why is this?


* Step 0: Getting an experiment running on rocks using qrsh: 
	* `cd /data/eliza4/he6_cres/simulation`
	* `./he6-cres-spec-sims/he6_cres_spec_sims/run_experiment.py -exp "/data/eliza4/he6_cres/simulation/sim_results/experiments/test_experiment_11082022.txt"`
